            <p>A Simple Project Built on MERN stack. The whole purpose of the project personally for me was to learn React as I am a Back-End Developer with horrible Front-end Skills.
              Another reason was to built something that would be of some value to others around me. The project is hosted on AWS EC2 FREE TIER but I would be more than willing to upgrade it 
              if it has gathers some attention.

                  <li>React.js for Front-End</li>
                  <li>Node.js for Back-End(wasn't really necessary but wrote backend first so it become legacy in a way and might add new features so keeping it as of now)</li>
                  <li>COVID 19 API Link to Docs <a href="https://covid-19-apis.postman.com/" target="__blank">here</a></li>
              </ul> 
            </p>

            This Project is in development and will Continue to be. The learning process never stops and there is a long way to go till I become some what proficient in making
            great UX and UI.
